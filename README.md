# Car-Price-Prediction-Model
Car Prediction Model is a Machine Learning Model which helps the users to predict the apporximate market value of their cars which they want to sell in second hand market.

The data is cleaned and Categorical Features are separated and then a test-train split is made and then RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION algorithm was used to get the predictions which gave an accuracy of about 94%
